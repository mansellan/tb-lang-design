Language Design for twinBASIC

This GitHub repository is for proposing, discussing and formalizing language syntax for the twinBASIC programming language.  In addition, the *twinBASIC Guiding Principles*, that are primarily used to evaluate proposed language syntax, are also defined here.

Please join us to help discuss newly proposed languange constructs for use in twinBASIC before they are adopted into the language.

Please create **_discussions_** for thrashing out new language syntax ideas before making a formal request.

Please create _**issues**_ ONLY for formally proposing new langauge syntax (or for extensions to existing language constructs).
